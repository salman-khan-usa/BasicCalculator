🧮 Tkinter Calculator – Python Mini Project
A fully functional calculator built using Python's Tkinter library. This GUI project supports basic arithmetic operations, square calculation, parentheses handling, backspace, and custom design styling. A simple but practical project to demonstrate Python GUI fundamentals and event handling.

📌 Features
🔢 Basic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

🧠 Smart parentheses: Automatically inserts * between digit and (

🧹 Clear (c) and Backspace (⌫) support

🧮 Square (x²) function for quick power of 2

🔄 Real-time expression evaluation

✨ Custom styled buttons using padding, fonts, and colors

🧠 Error handling for invalid inputs

🚀 Technologies Used
Python 3

Tkinter (built-in GUI library)

🧠 How It Works
The main display is an Entry widget where expressions are built dynamically.

Each button is individually packed inside Frames.

Button clicks are handled via a common click() function using .bind().

Evaluation of expressions is handled using Python’s eval() with error handling.
